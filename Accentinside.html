							<span class="image main"><img src="images/Accent inside image.webp" alt="" /></span>
							<p>The project titled "Accent Recognition using Mel Frequency Cepstral Coefficients and Supervised Learning Algorithms" conducted by Sriram Thatipamula aims to enhance speech processing technology by focusing on accent classification across six different languages. The project emphasizes the importance of recognizing accents prior to speech processing to improve system performance, especially in languages with diverse accent variations. The primary technique employed for feature extraction is Mel Frequency Cepstral Coefficients (MFCC), known for its robustness in handling diverse speaking styles and background noise. The project utilizes a dataset comprising 329 speakers with six distinct accents to develop and evaluate a reliable and efficient accent detection model.</p>
							<p>The project's approach involves several key phases, including data collection, preprocessing, feature selection, and model implementation. Data collection was conducted using a dataset sourced from the UC Irvine website, consisting of 329 speakers exhibiting one of six distinct accents. The collected data underwent preprocessing steps, including rounding off continuous values, label encoding of categorical attributes, and normalization to ensure consistent scaling. Feature selection focused on identifying relevant characteristics from the dataset that could differentiate between various languages or accents. The chosen features were then transformed or scaled to ensure equal contribution to model learning. Various supervised machine learning algorithms, such as Decision Trees, Random Forest, K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN), Support Vector Machines (SVM), and Neural Networks, were implemented and evaluated using the preprocessed data to develop the accent detection model.</p>
							<p>The project's outcomes carry significant implications for advancing speech processing applications, particularly in sectors like automatic speech recognition, voice-controlled systems, and personalized language interfaces. The evaluation results revealed that the KNN algorithm exhibited the highest accuracy compared to other implemented models, demonstrating its effectiveness in predicting speaker accents. Despite the project's success, certain limitations and assumptions were acknowledged, emphasizing the need for continuous feature selection, parameter tuning, and model refinement to improve performance and generalizability. Overall, the project contributes to the evolution of speech processing technology by facilitating the development of sophisticated, context-aware systems capable of recognizing and adapting to diverse language landscapes, thereby promising enhanced user experiences and application usability.</p>
