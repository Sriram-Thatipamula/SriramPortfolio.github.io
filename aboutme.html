							<p>Welcome to my professional portfolio! I’m Sriram, a passionate data science graduate dedicated to uncovering the stories hidden within data. My journey into the world of data science began with a curiosity about how data can drive decision-making and create impactful solutions. Over the years, I have refined my skills across various domains, including data analysis, data engineering, machine learning, and data visualization, as well as big data modeling. Each of these areas has allowed me to explore innovative approaches to problem-solving and to contribute meaningfully to data-driven projects.</p>
							<p>I hold a Master’s degree in Data Science from the University of Memphis, where I established a strong foundation in database management systems (DBMS), big data technologies, data visualization, machine learning, statistical and biostatistical analysis, data mining, and cloud computing platforms. My academic journey ignited a deep fascination with extracting insights from complex datasets, prompting me to explore a variety of tools and technologies, including Python, R, SQL, Tableau, and more. I am committed to continually enhancing my knowledge and staying updated on the latest trends and advancements in the field of data science.</p>


							
							<p>During my time at Cognizant Technology Solutions, I have had the privilege of working on diverse projects that challenged my analytical abilities and creativity. At Cognizant Technology Solutions, I developed and designed data integration and migration solutions in Azure. My role involved performing data processing and transformation operations, managing databases, and building efficient ETL pipelines. This experience underscored the importance of collaboration and effective communication, as translating complex data findings into actionable insights is crucial for driving business success.</p>
							
							<p>During my time at Inteq Software LLP as a Data Engineer Intern, I gained proficiency in big data technologies, cloud platforms, and large-scale datasets. I learned utilizing Hadoop ecosystem tools (HDFS, MapReduce, Hive, Pig, YARN) for distributed data storage and processing. I was skilled on AWS services (Amazon S3, Redshift, AWS Glue, Amazon RDS, DynamoDB) for data storage, management, and processing. I designed and built ETL pipelines for ingesting, transforming, and loading structured and unstructured data into cloud and on-premises databases. I enhanced my skills in version control using Git, enabling collaboration, version tracking, and deployment of data pipelines.</p>

							<p>During my time at Inteq Software LLP as a Data Analyst Intern, I was skilled in data analysis, visualization, and predictive modeling. I developed expertise in key areas like data cleaning, wrangling, and feature engineering to enhance data quality and model accuracy. Proficient in SQL and Python, I efficiently query and analyze large datasets to uncover business insights. Additionally, I’ve worked with Tableau and Excel to create dynamic, interactive dashboards, using visual elements.</p>
							
							<p>
							<p>In addition to my technical expertise, I pride myself on my excellent communication, team collaboration, critical thinking, problem-solving, and customer support skills. These soft skills have been instrumental in my ability to collaborate effectively with cross-functional teams, communicate insights to stakeholders, and identify data-driven solutions to business challenges.</p>
							<p>Certified in Python programming and various other tools and technologies, I am committed to continuous learning and professional development. I am eager to leverage my diverse skill set and expertise as a Data Engineer, Data Analyst, Business Analyst, Data Scientist or Machine Learning Engineer to contribute to the growth and success of forward-thinking organizations.</p>
							<p>Whether you're interested in exploring my academic projects, professional experience, or simply learning more about my journey in the world of Data Science, I invite you to navigate through my portfolio and connect with me on LinkedIn or via email. Let's innovate, collaborate, and make data work for us!</p>
